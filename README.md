Makes startup loading time faster by **60%**

## What it does
Before loading asset bundles, they will be decompressed into `Lethal Company Game/Cache/AssetBundles`. Decompressing can help with slow loading of asset bundles or high RAM usage.

## Where decompressed asset bundles are stored
They are stored in `Lethal Company Game/Cache/AssetBundles`.
